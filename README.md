ðŸ‘‹  Who are you?

- G'day my name is Adam, for the past 10 years I've been working in the construction industry. Specifically high-risk construction jobs (abseiling, confined space, rigging, elevated work platforms). 

ðŸ‘· How does a construction worker end up on Github? 

- I've decided to change industries and started studying data analytics and ML. 


I've finished a few projects using multiple Python libraries. Have a look at my [porfolio](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/), it's full of well known datasets and projects. But in each and every one of them I've tried to find a new and original approach to the dataset. If I couldn't find anything new in the data, and my project would look the same as every other notebook, I've collected new data (like in [Fandango project](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/eda/fandango)). No idea or room for new data? Then I've grabbed a brush and worked on the visualizations. (eg. [Star Wars](https://github.com/grumpyclimber/portfolio/tree/main/eda/star_wars)). At this stage I'm focusing on machine learning projects.
